<h1>Summary</h1>
<p><strong>Age 65+ per bed</strong></p>
<p>By far the highest ratios of population 65 and older per assisted
living capacity are located in rural areas. In our entirely rural
counties it’s 33 people age 65 or older per assisted living capacity
compared to 22, 20 and 15 in town/rural mix, urban/town/rural mix and
entirely urban counties, respectively.</p>
<p>Counties on the west side of the state and in the central lakes
region are particularly high.</p>
<p><strong>Assisted living capacity as percentage of nursing home bed
declines</strong></p>
<p>To try and get a sense of the role assisted living might play in
serving older populations we looked at the percentage this capacity
makes up of all the declines in nursing home beds since 2005.</p>
<p>Again, there are stark differences across rural and urban. As a
state, assisted living capacity makes up nearly 500% of the losses in
nursing home beds, but this is largely due to significantly higher
density of them in urban areas. Entirely urban counties have assisted
living capacity that makes up for over 800% of the loss in nursing
homes. In entirely rural counties, the assisted living capacity does not
fully make up for all the losses in nursing home beds - 93%.</p>
<p>The percentages are particularly low in counties in the Northwest,
Southwest, and Cass County.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, they only started licensing these facilities in 2021.
The law established regulatory standards governing the provision of
housing and services in assisted living facilities and assisted living
facilities with dementia care to help ensure the health, safety,
well-being, and appropriate treatment of residents.</p>
<p>In 2024, there are 2,215 facilities in Minnesota.</p>

<h1>Capacity</h1>
<p>Since we only have one year of data, in this section we explore the
differences in capacity across the state but no trends. To keep capacity
relative, we will use a couple of difference ratios;</p>
<ul>

<li>ratio of skilled nursing home beds to assisted living beds.</li>

<h2 class="tabset">Age 65+ per bed</h2>
<p>The charts below show the number of people that are 65 or older per
assisted living bed. Consistently, rural areas have some of the highest
number of 65+ per bed. In Minnesota, there are 17 people age 65+ per
bed, however, it’s significantly higher in rural Minnesota. In our
entirely rural counties, there are 33 people age 65+ per assisted living
bed, compared to 22 in town/rural mix, 20 in urban/town/rural mix, and
15 in entirely urban counties.</p>
<p>Counties along the borders and in the central lakes are particularly
high.</p>

<h2 class="tabset">Assisted living capacity as perentage of nursing home
decline</h2>
<p>Let’s see how much these beds make up for the loss in nursing home
beds.</p>
<p>The charts below is an attempt to tell the story of how much assisted
living capacity can make up for the decline in nursing home beds. Even
though that isn’t an apples-to-apples comparison, it does at least
provide an idea of the role that assisted living is attempting to
fill.</p>
<p>In Minnesota, assisted living makes up almost 500% of the decline in
nursing home beds statewide.</p>
<p>At a regional level, the percentage varies significantly depending on
rural-urbanness. The assisted living capacity in the seven county metro
and Central planning regions make up a significantly higher percentage
of their declines in nursing home beds - 795% and 622% respectively.
However, it drops pretty significantly in the other regions. Northwest
and Southwest in particular only have a bit over 200% of their decline
in nursing home beds made up through assisted living.</p>
<p>When grouping counties by rural-ness, entirely rural counties don’t
even have enough assisted living capacity to make up for the entire
decline of nursing home beds - 93%. The county map shows that the lowest
percentages are located in Northwest and Southwest Minnesota, as well as
Cass County in North Central.</p>

<h3>Planning Region</h3>
<p>Assisted living units in more metropolitan areas make up a far larger
percentage of the decline in nursing home beds. Assisted living
facilities in the seven county metro have 800% more capacity than the
decline in nursing home beds. In our rural areas, it averages 200% to
400%.</p>
