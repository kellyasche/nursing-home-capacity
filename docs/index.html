<div id="section-terminology" class="section level1">
<h1>Terminology</h1>
<p><em>Board and care homes</em> These small private facilities, also
called residential care facilities or group homes, usually have 20 or
fewer residents. Rooms may be private or shared. Residents receive
personal care and meals, and staff are available around the clock.
Nursing and medical care usually are not provided at the home.</p>
<p>In most cases, you must pay the costs of living at a board and care
home. Medicare does not cover these costs. Medicaid may provide partial
coverage, depending on the state and whether the person is eligible. If
the older person has long-term care insurance, check their plan to see
if it includes coverage for this type of facility.</p>
<p><em>Nursing homes</em> Nursing homes, also called skilled nursing
facilities, provide a wide range of health and personal care services.
Their services focus more on medical care than most assisted living
facilities or board and care homes. Services offered in a nursing home
typically include nursing care, 24-hour supervision, three meals a day,
and assistance with everyday activities. Rehabilitation services, such
as physical, occupational, and speech therapy, are also available.</p>
<p>In many cases, people must pay for nursing home care themselves.
Medicare generally doesn’t cover long-term stays in a nursing home, but
it may pay for some related costs, such as doctor services and medical
supplies. Medicaid may also cover some of the costs of nursing homes for
people who are eligible based on income and personal resources. If the
older person has long-term care insurance, the policy may include some
coverage for nursing home care. Check with the insurance company for
details.</p>
<p><em>Assisted living</em> Assisted living is for people who need help
with daily care, but not as much help as a nursing home provides.
Assisted living facilities range in size from as few as 25 residents to
100 or more. Typically, a few levels of care are offered, and residents
pay more if they need extra services or special care.</p>
<p>Assisted living residents usually live in their own apartments or
rooms and share common areas. They have access to many services,
including up to three meals a day; assistance with personal care; help
with medications, housekeeping, and laundry; 24-hour supervision,
security, and on-site staff; and social and recreational activities.
Some assisted living facilities are part of a larger organization that
also offers other levels of care. For example, continuing care
retirement communities may also offer independent living and skilled
nursing care. Exact arrangements vary by facility and by state.</p>
<p>Most people pay the full costs of assisted living themselves. This
option tends to be more expensive than living independently but less
expensive than a nursing home. Medicare does not pay for assisted
living. Medicaid may provide coverage for some aspects of assisted
living, depending on the state and whether the person is eligible. This
care option is partially covered by some long-term care insurance
policies.</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>
<div id="section-nursing-homes" class="section level2">
<h2>Nursing Homes</h2>
<p>Bed capacity across Minnesota has been declining since 2005. Overall,
bed capacity has declined 33% from 2005 to 2024. The most severe
declines have occurred in rural counties - Cass (-93%), Grant (-65%),
Swift (-69%), Pine (-65%), and Faribault (-63%). By region, the largest
declines have occurred in Northwest (-43%), Southwest (-38%), Southeast
(33%), Northeast (-31%), Seven County Metro (-30%) and Central
(-25%).</p>
<p>When looking at bed capacity as a per capita (age 65+) value, this
has increased from having 20 people age 65+ per skilled nursing facility
bed in 2005 to 49 people age 65+ per skilled nursing facility bed in
Minnesota. The most severe per capita values are located in North
Central Minnesota - Pine: 1,387 per bed, Cass: 271 per bed, Hubbarb: 114
per bed, and Crow Wing with 103 per bed. A few of the suburbs also had
higher per capita values - Anoka: 148 per bed, Carver: 104 per bed,
Dakota: 89 per bed and Washington with 80 per bed.</p>
<p>Interestingly, at a rural-urban basis, the more urban a county group
was the higher the per capita of 65+ per bed capacity was - Entirely
urban was 60 people per bed and it shrinks to 23 people per bed for our
entirely rural county group.</p>
<p>Although it would seem that rural areas might be better off in terms
of bed availability, one large concern is the amount of beds that are
missing due to facility closures rather than currently operating
facilities that have chosen to shrink their bed capacity. A higher
percentage of facility closures tracks with how rural a county is -
entirely rural counties have lost 26% of their facilities, town/rural
mix counties have lost 21%, urban/town/rural county mix has lost 16%
while entirely urban counties have lost only 9%.</p>
<p>What this means for rural areas is that there is possibly less
flexibility in expanding bed availability if demand increases. For our
entirely rural counties, 58% of the decline in bed capacity is from
facility closure.</p>
<p>We know that rural facilities are smaller in size. In 2024, the
average facility size was 45 beds compared to 59 for town/rural mix
counties, 66 for urban/town/rural mix and 89 beds for entirely urban
counties. Even more striking is the difference at the 75% quartile -
entirely rural counties had 50 beds where as entirely urban had 105
beds. This shows that there are significantly larger facilities in our
more urban areas.</p>
<p>This is concerning because we see that smaller facilities are
significantly more likely to close. The table below shows the statistics
and comparitively the facilities that have remained open since 2005 are
significantly larger.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-assisted-living" class="section level2">
<h2>Assisted living</h2>
<p>The capacity of assisted living is not nearly as robust in rural
Minnesota compared to our more urban areas. Ratios of population 65 and
older per assisted living capacity unit shows that they range from 33
people per capacity unit in entirely rural counties down to 15 in
entirely urban counties.</p>
<p>In addition, the ability for assisted living to make up for the
decline in nursing home beds is significantly less in rural areas. In
our entirely urban counties, assisted living made up over 800% of the
loss in nursing home beds. In entirely rural areas, assisted living
doesn’t make up for the entire loss of nursing home beds - 93%.</p>

<h2>Home health care</h2>
<p>Using the QWEC data, there are serious concerns about rural’s ability
to meet the upcoming demands for elderly care. Admittedly, it’s a bit
difficult to interpret due to not knowing what locations are being
served. It could be that a lot of the metro based home health care
establishments are serving rural Minnesota. I sure hope so, because this
doesn’t look good.</p>
<p>When look at establishments, the seven county metro has 75% of the
total while the rest of Minnesota has bout 5% per planning region. This
is about the same for employment.</p>
<p>When looking at the population 65 and older per home health care
establishment - the seven county metro has 869 individuals per home
health care establishment while the other planning regions have 2,500+
per establishment. Employment mimics a similar pattern.</p>
