# Research question

There are five primary drivers in the increase in assisted living and residential care market;

1. Federal and state efforts to move individuals from institutional to noninstitutional or community-based settings.
2. Advances in medical care and technology have altered both demand and need for institutional care.
3. There is a consumer preference shift for more independent living.
4. Assisted living is perceived more positively compared to nursing homes.
5. Assisted living communities are less costly.

# Exploration of data

Due to these facts, it would seem necessary to highlight the trends in these types of institutions - non-institutional and institutional care;

* Where are they located?
* What is their capacity?


The following is a list of characteristics/attributes that we would like to explore in the data;

Profile of institutional and non-institutional settings for each region of Minnesota

* Nursing homes
  + Private vs. non-profit 
  + Bed availability
  + Reasons for declines in availability - financial vs. workforce shortages
  + Staffing
  + Projected demand

* Assisted living facilities
  + Private vs. non-profit
  + Trends in capacity
  + Services offered
  + Staffing
